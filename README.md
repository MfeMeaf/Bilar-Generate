# Bilar-Generate

This was a very small project to try out object constructors.
You can generate your own cars with name - price - picture "url img from google"....

### Am I satisfied?
It could have been better regarding how the cars are generated such as insteado of using prompts it might have been better to have a form instead
where you could input the needed information or a different page for it but overall it worked well enought.

### Want to use this code?
Free free to do it, there should be no complex thinking needed to get started.
